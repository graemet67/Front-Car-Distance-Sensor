A simple project to add front distance sensors to my car.  My vehicle is a VW Scirroco but mount will also work with MK6 Golf.  Distance is displayed on both the OLED display in cm and via the bar graph - a beeper sounds and display flashes when an object is within 300mm.  Both of these values can be easily changed in the Arduino code.

The list of required parts is in the Wiring and BOM folder.

Note the PCB requires soldering of 0306 SMD resistors.  This can be done with a normal soldering iron but is fiddly.
